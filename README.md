## Hi there 👋

I am Maxi Wendlinger, PhD student at Technical University of Munich and researcher at Fraunhofer AISEC. My main research interests lie on the interactions of transparency and security in NLP/ Deep Learning Systems. More recently, I am particularly interested in using internal representations to investigate concepts of security in of foundation models, and using activation engineering to optimize model behavior.
